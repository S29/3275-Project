password: superpassword




/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h ip-172-31-47-157 password 'new-password'


Alternatively you can run:
/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.
